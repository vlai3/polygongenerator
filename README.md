# polygongenerator

A module for generating images of polygons. The images are of randomly generated filled in polygons with a differently
coloured background. It is possible to specify if the polygons should be concave or convex, the number of vertices the
polygon should have, the colour of the background of the image, the colour of the polygon, and the height and width of
the image to be generated.

In addition to having a module for generating polygons, there is also one for creating a graphical user interface to
easily be able to generate polygons easily.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites for installing the software is included in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

## Running the GUI

An executable file is included to be able to easily run the polygon generator. To run GUI (on Windows), download the
```dist``` folder. Then navigate into the ```polygon_generator_gui``` folder, then run the
```polygon_generator_gui.exe``` file.

From the GUI it is possible to customize the kind of polygon to generate, and to see a sample of the polygon that will
be drawn before selecting the number to generate and the location to generate the image files.
